# hello-world

So this is where I experiment with html. <br>
The code you see should be run in <em>developer tools.</em><br>
Now how do you get there, you might ask? Well, it's pretty easy. First, you push down on the keys SHIFT, COMMAND/CTRL, and I. Then, delete everything you see and paste in the code. Simple!
